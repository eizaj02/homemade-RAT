Homemade RAT with python
i advice you using any linux distro then change the ip address inside the code to match your target ip and your local ip
you can modify ts whatever you want and sorry but this RAT still poorly developed it's still lack on function and handling
the tools include uploading file, downloading file, screenshot, screenshare, start cam, keylogger, and it can execute persistence on the target machine
it's not fully undetectable but it take long for the antivirus to react
by typing 'help' you can see the tools
if you want to execute persistence you should convert the 'target.py' to exe with auto-py-to-exe
that's all
