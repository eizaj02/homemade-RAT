# About:
This RAT is only a PoC project, this still has alot of Errors and won't work if you run the client on different computers unless you did a tunneling or a port forwarding.  
If you wanna run the client-side in exe file, you can use pyinstaller for the CLI version, and auto-py-to-exe for the GUI version.  

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

for CLI version or  


```bash
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```

for GUI version
